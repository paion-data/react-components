**FastUI** is a TypeScript React+Webpack web app template that lets us spin up frontend project quickly through
[GitHub templates]. One can think of it as the monorepo version of Facebooks's [Create React App] but with intense focus
and improvements on software CI/CD, such as automated testing. At the end of the day, FastUI helps organization
to improve the velocity and quality of their teams' work.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Unlike Create React App's [eject mechanism](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject), FastUI gives developer **total control of every aspect of frontend
> development**; all configs are surfaced and directly tunable, such as Jest Babel configs, without "ejecting" or
> dependence on external config library.
